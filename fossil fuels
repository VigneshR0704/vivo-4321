Fossil fuels—such as coal, oil, and natural gas—are 
ancient energy sources formed from the remains of plants
and animals buried under layers of earth millions of years ago. These fuels have played a 
critical role in industrialization, powering everything from cars to factories, and are the
backbone of modern energy systems. However, burning fossil fuels releases significant amounts
of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, contributing to global warming and climate change. As the world grapples with 
these environmental challenges, there is a growing push towards
renewable energy sources like wind, solar, and hydroelectric power to reduce dependency on fossil fuels and foster a more sustainable future.
